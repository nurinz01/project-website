            <p>Here is the exterior view of the COACH Airways, and personally, I really like the design on the aircraft. It gives off a feeling of luxury and elegance. 
            In my opinion, using this plane to attract people to make purchases here is a smart move, showing my ability to spot opportunities and capture the attention of the public.
            My experience when I first entered was truly captivating. The interior design was equally stunning, with a wide variety of handbags beautifully displayed on the shelves. 
            It was the perfect setting for anyone looking to purchase a handbag from this prestigious brand.
            <br><br>
            The atmosphere inside also plays a crucial role, as the lighting, decorations, and other details truly give it an airplane-like feel. 
            I felt as though the place was inviting me to stay and never leave, creating a sense of comfort and allure that was hard to resist.
            In addition, COACH Airways also offers a designated spot for OOTD photos at the front, providing an opportunity for the public to take pictures and create lasting memories after entering the store.
            <br><br>
            Luxury begins here, where sophistication meets indulgence and excellence never ends.

            I also had the opportunity to visit Encore Melaka, a place perfect for OOTD shots, with its unique and stunning architectural design. 
            Encore Melaka is a theater located in Melaka. What makes it truly fascinating is the rotating audience platform, which spins 360 degrees during performances. 
            This unique feature makes Encore Melaka a popular venue for hosting various shows and performances. 
            Encore Melaka can be compared to iconic venues like Istana Budaya or the Sydney Opera House.
            <br><br>
            Not only that, behind Encore Melaka lies the Straits of Malacca. 
            This adds to its appeal as it is situated very close to the strait, further enhancing the beauty of the building.
            For anyone who has the chance, make sure to visit this place at least once. 
            It’s truly worth the visit, especially if you get the opportunity to experience the theater itself.

            As shown in the pictures above, this was the most enjoyable activity I experienced during my time in Malacca. 
            I took the opportunity to try this activity at Elements Mall Malacca. I was incredibly excited as it was my first time playing this game with my three roommates. 
            To describe the moment, I felt immense joy being able to play together with them. 
            The venue was perfectly suited for this type of game, making the entire experience truly satisfying and worthwhile.
            <br><br>
            I was also able to enjoy the game to the fullest because there was no time limit until the bullets were used up. 
            Overall, I would rate this experience a perfect 10 out of 10. 
            It’s definitely worth trying, and there are many other games to explore at Elements Mall Malacca.
